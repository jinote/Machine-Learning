__How do you interpret correlation in Python?__

* In other words, larger x values correspond to larger y values and vice versa. 
* The value r > 0 indicates positive correlation between x and y. 
* The value r = 0 corresponds to the case in which there's no linear relationship between x and y. 
* The value r < 0 indicates negative correlation between x and y.
